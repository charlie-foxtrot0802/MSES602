# **AWS Course Review**

# Pros
- Well organized material.
- Good introduction to cloud-based operations.
- Labs are straight forward and related to the module that they are nested in.
- The videos are concise and too the point and the student guide for each module is almost identical to the information provided in the videos.  Gives different learning styles opportunities to have access to the same material.
- Labs were incrementally more complex and knowledge was built upon on subsequent labs.

# Cons
- There was a lot of focus on the Amazon Web Services business side of the house.  While this is important for someone dealing with operations and budgeting I think it was unnecessary how much time was spent on cost and subscription/service models for a DevOps class.
- There was a lot of interacting with AWS services, but the course did not provide any parallels between what we are learning during lecture and in other parts of the class.  Mostly there is little to no "code as infrastructure work." My guess is there is a lot of that going on behind the scenes, but we never had to build .yml or .yamls.
