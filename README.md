Written Assignment
Provide an evaluation of the Cloud Track for this class (specially the AWS training). What did you like?
What did you not like? Should the Cloud Track be used for future classes?

# **AWS Course Review**

# Pros
- Well organized material.
- Good introduction to cloud-based operations.
- Labs are straight forward and related to the module that they are nested in.
- The videos are concise and too the point and the student guide for each module is almost identical to the information provided in the videos.  Gives different learning styles opportunities to have access to the same material.
- Labs were incrementally more complex and knowledge was built upon on subsequent labs.
- Labs were performed directly on instances of AWS services.  So very real-life training.

# Cons
- There was a lot of focus on the Amazon Web Services business side of the house.  While this is important for someone dealing with operations and budgeting I think it was unnecessary how much time was spent on cost and subscription/service models for a DevOps class.
- There was a lot of interacting with AWS services, but the course did not provide any parallels between what we are learning during lecture and in other parts of the class.  Mostly there is little to no "code as infrastructure work." My guess is there is a lot of that going on behind the scenes, but we never had to build .yml or .yaml's.
- While I am sure there is significant similarities between Amazon and the other cloud providers (Microsoft, and Google), this only taught how to use AWS products.

# Overall Thoughts

I think that offering the AWS cloud-based coursework was great.  For myself personally because I have no experience with cloud operations it helped fill in a pretty significant gap in my knowledge.  As of now it seems like we are wrapping up the cloud track a couple of weeks early and have already discussed what we should be focusing on in the last two weeks of the course.  In retrospect I think perhaps that the cloud track should be included in the coursework, but perhaps as the second half of the course.  I am unsure of the scope, but I think after learning VM's and Vagrant, then seeing you give demonstrations of how to spin up VM's using code as infrastructure (kubernetes deployments, Vagrant files, and you spoke of Terraform) that perhaps a couple weeks more of how to build vagrant, terraform, and kubernetes files to deploy on cloud environments would be useful.  Especially since all of those could span all cloud services available.  After that additional introductory knowledge we would then proceed onto the AWS course to get familiarized with cloud operations.
