# What are the Pros and Cons of The Three Cloud Service Models?

| Cloud Model                        |             Pros             |               Cons           | 
| :--------------------------------: | :--------------------------: | :--------------------------: |
| Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) | |
| | - Most similar to existing IT resources. | - Security is outsourced to vendor. |
| | - Allows for scalability of operations. | - Might still be more costly due to hardware procurement an maintenance. |
| | - Allow direct control of your own resources. | - Limited control of networking components. |
| | - Can control what OS you are using and storage solutions. | |
| Platform as a Service (Paas) | | 
| | - Not required to manage your own physical infrastructure. | - Can lack scalability capabilities. |
| | - Libaries, service, and tools are provided. | - Does not control network, storage, or operating system. |
| | | - Can be difficult to move from vendor to vendor with this model. |
Software as a Service (SaaS) | | |
| | - Lowest barrier to entry, easiest to get into. | - No control over systems, use what vendor offers. |
| | - Easily scalable operations, just upgrade plans to accommodate more users. | - Can have software conflicts with provider. |
| | - Can access your product from almost anywhere there is a web browser. | |
