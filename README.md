Written Assignment
Provide an evaluation of the Cloud Track for this class (specially the AWS training). What did you like?
What did you not like? Should the Cloud Track be used for future classes?

# **AWS Course Review**

# Pros
- Well organized material.
- Good introduction to cloud-based operations.
- Labs are straight forward and related to the module that they are nested in.
- The videos are concise and too the point and the student guide for each module is almost identical to the information provided in the videos.  Gives different learning styles opportunities to have access to the same material.

# Cons
- Alot of focus on the Amazon Web Services business side of the house.  While this is important for someone dealing with operations I think it was unecessary how much time was spent on cost and subscription/service models for a DevOps class.
